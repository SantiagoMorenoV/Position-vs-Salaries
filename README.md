# Did the interviewee tell the truth?

An HR recruiter has interviewed a potential candidate. She thinks the interviewee could be a great fit for the organization since he has the desired experience, skills, and qualities. However, when the interviewee was asked about his salary expectations, he replied that he was expecting $ 160k per year because that was what he earned in his previous job.

She collected data for different positions and salaries of the candidate's previous company on various websites. Now, she wants to know whether the candidate was being honest or not. So, she gives you the data for you to help her solve this business problem. Additionally, she searched for him on LinkedIn and discovered that the candidate had been working as Regional Manager for two years in his last employ.

For this project, I estimated two models,  a polynomial regression and a linear one, then compared both of their predictions, implemented the polynomial prediction, and then wrote a brief discussion to see if this person was honest to the recruiter.
